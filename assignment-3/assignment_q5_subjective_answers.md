![Max absolute thetha vs degree](q5.png)<br />
Conclusion: <br />
The max absolute thetha value is decreasing with increase in the value of degree upto d=3. This is because as more polynomial features are added, the coefficient value gets distributed to the different terms. This indicates that the added terms are adding value to our regression model. However, after d=3, the max absolute thetha remains constant at a value close to 0.9, because the the model is overfitting the data. The new terms are not adding any value to the model. <br />
So, we have concluded that the model overfits after d=3.
